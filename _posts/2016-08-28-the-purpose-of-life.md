The Purpose of Life
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c5059aa8-a306-49fd-881a-4d98e9b5607d.jpg)

The purpose of 'human being' = being human

The purpose of Life = life itself

The purpose of the experience of life = to experience

The Universe, the Whole, Oneness, God, the Devine or what ever name you want to give the 'greater indescribable' behind it all has created dualisme / polarities for us to experience both sides of every experience. The Conscious Society honors this in every aspect. Every experience has its value, its lesson, its gem. Without separating there is no possibility to unify. Without dead there is no possibility to experience life. Without inhale there is no possibility to exhale. The journey of conscious living is not about suppressing the negative and only desiring the positive according to our conditioning. It is about embracing all experiences, living them, experiencing them and growing beyond them
